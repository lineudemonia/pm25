# A preliminary look at Beijing's PM 2.5
This is a quick look at beijing's PM 2.5 trendlines. The PM 2.5 data is downloaded via US embassy's recorded data over the years. 

The original data can be downloaded at http://www.stateair.net/web/historical/1/1.html. I've used all the valid data points. Again, thanks to the US embassy for keeping this dataset alive.

It roughly seems Beijing's air condition is de facto improving over the years on both mean and median observations. 
However, if one looks at intra-day PM 2.5 (which does make some sense as a long-term measurement of air quality), Beijing is getting slightly worse.

Need some further exploration obviously.
